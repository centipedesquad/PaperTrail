# PaperTrail — Project Instructions

## Package Manager
Use `uv` for all Python dependency management.

## UI Guidelines
- NO emojis in buttons or UI elements
- Keep interface clean and professional

## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.

## Git Commits
Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" signatures to commits.

## Database Migrations
- Each migration file MUST have a unique numeric prefix (e.g., `001_`, `002_`). Two files sharing a prefix causes the second to be silently skipped on upgrades.
- The migration manager uses `executescript` for SQL files and tracks version via `migration.split('_')[0]`.
- FTS5 contentless tables (with `content=''`) do NOT support direct UPDATE or DELETE. Use the special syntax: `INSERT INTO tbl(tbl, rowid, ...) VALUES('delete', ...)` for deletes, and delete-then-reinsert for updates. Note: a table WITHOUT any `content=` clause is a regular FTS5 table where normal DELETE/UPDATE work — the special syntax is ONLY for `content=''` or `content=tablename`.
- The `authors` column in FTS5 is computed from joins — it does NOT exist on the `papers` table. Never use `content=papers` with an `authors` column.

## Thread Safety
- `DatabaseConnection.execute()` auto-commits outside `transaction()` blocks via the `_in_transaction` flag.
- All multi-statement DB operations must use `with db.transaction():` to prevent interleaving across QThread workers.
- Workers must be cancelled and `wait()`-ed before cleanup. Check `wait()` return value — don't `deleteLater()` a thread that's still running.
- Lambda closures in signal connections must capture IDs by value (default arg), not object references that can go stale.

## Platform
- macOS is the primary target, Linux secondary.
- Use `sys.platform == 'darwin'` to branch platform-specific behavior (Finder vs xdg-open, /Applications vs /usr/bin, *.app filter).
- Legacy arXiv IDs contain `/` (e.g., `hep-th/9901001`) — sanitize with `.replace('/', '_')` before using as filenames or directory names.

## Bug Fixing Protocol
After implementing any bug fix:
1. **Check for regressions** — Verify the fix doesn't break adjacent functionality. Trace the full call chain of any modified function and confirm callers still behave correctly.
2. **Validate FTS5 triggers** — If modifying FTS5 migrations, test that INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, and author-update triggers all work. Contentless FTS tables do NOT support direct UPDATE or DELETE — use the special `INSERT INTO tbl(tbl,...) VALUES('delete',...)` syntax.
3. **Validate signal/slot flows** — If modifying Qt signal handlers, confirm that emitted signals carry the correct data and that `current_paper`/state hasn't changed between emit and handler execution.
4. **Fix regressions before reporting done** — Do not mark a bug as fixed if the fix introduces a new bug. Verify end-to-end before committing.
5. **Update BUGS.md** — After fixing bugs, update both the open bugs section and the "Fixed Bugs — User-Facing Impact" table at the end of the file.
